# Task-Fragmentation
AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

First of all, I lack the complete context, so many assumptions I make could be either correct or incorrect regarding the two assignments.

My Pick - 
• Fragment the UI into selective components to make it more readable   
• Fragment the functionality into a custom hook that will be reusable through out the app.
